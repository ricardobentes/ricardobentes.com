Hi! I am Ricardo, glad you stopped by!

Software developer by trade and curious by nature, I like to spend my free time learning about whatever pulls my attention in that moment.

My main interests are interesting stuff.

If you want to know more about me, feel free to check my CV, my flickr photography page, my GitHub project page or just drop me an email and say hi.
